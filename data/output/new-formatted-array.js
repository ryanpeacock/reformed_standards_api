      "The fourth commandment is, Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.",

      "The conclusion of the Lord’s prayer (which is, For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.),",
      "teaches us to enforce our petitions with arguments,",
      "which are to be taken, not from any worthiness in ourselves, or in any other creature, but from God;",
      "and with our prayers to join praises,",
      "ascribing to God alone eternal sovereignty, omnipotency, and glorious excellency;",
      "in regard whereof, as he is able and willing to help us,",
      "so we by faith are emboldened to plead with him that he would,",
      "and quietly to rely upon him, that he will fulfil our requests.",
